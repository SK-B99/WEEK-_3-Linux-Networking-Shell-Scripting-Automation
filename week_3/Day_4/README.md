# DAY 4 – Automation & Task Scheduling

## Topics: 
cron jobs, logging, script scheduling, automation patterns

`cron` is a daemon to execute scheduled commands. In Linux, a daemon is a non-interactive program that operates continuously in the background. A cron job is a Linux program that allows users to schedule the execution of a piece of software, often in the form of a shell script or a compiled executable.

### Common crontab Commands
- List cron jobs: `crontab -l`
- Start the cron service: `sudo systemctl start cron`
- Stop the cron service: `sudo systemctl stop cron`
- Remove all cron jobs: `crontab -r`

Cron jobs typically follow this format: **minute (m)**, **hour (h)**, **day of the month (d)**, **month (m)**, **day of the week (w)**.

### Example of a cron job
*/2 * 2,15 * * echo "hi from cron" >> /home/sammy/ex.txt


This will run the command and append "hi from cron" to the `ex.txt` file **every 2 minutes**, but **only on the 2nd and 15th days** of each month, regardless of the month or day of the week.

The lab was to create a cron job that runs a script every 5 minutes and writes output to a file. The dedicated Linux directory for log storage is `/var/log`. This location stores logs generated by the operating system, its services, and the various applications running on the system.

For the lab, I wrote a script that used the `traceroute` command to trace the route to `google.com`. I used the `grep` command to extract the IP addresses and appended the output every 5 minutes to a log file (`cron_analysis.log`) as shown in Figure 9.

The scheduled cron job is displayed in Figure 10.

Figure 11 shows the output of the cron job accumulating every 5 minutes.

Linux automation is a vital component of modern DevOps and systems administration. It plays a key role in the management and maintenance of large-scale Linux environments. Through automation, organizations can achieve several benefits, including the reduction of manual errors and increased efficiency.

Timestamps are records of the specific times when actions are executed on files in Linux. In Figure 12, I automated a backup of a directory called `week_3`.
