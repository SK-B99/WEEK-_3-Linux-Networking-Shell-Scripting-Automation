DAY 1 – Networking Fundamentals

Topics : IP addresses, DNS, ping, traceroute, curl, wget


An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device, usually written in octets. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly names like google.com into machine-readable IP addresses. Tools such as ping help check if a server is reachable by measuring response time. cURL allows users to send requests and retrieve data from URLs, while wget is used to download files or entire websites. Together, these tools provide a practical foundation for network troubleshooting and data retrieval. I ping google.com packets were transmitted and received as shown in Figure 1.  ![Figure 1].(day 1.png)
I did a traceroute on google.com and it showed the path my data took from my local computer to the destination, which is google.com Figure 2.
